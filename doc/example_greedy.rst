PyMP Tutorial 3. Greedy decomposition
=====================================

There are many variants of the MP algorithm. Only a few of them are directly implemented in PyMP.
In the first tutorial, we saw some variants of the selection step (e.g. RSSMP). Here we're interested 
in the update step.
